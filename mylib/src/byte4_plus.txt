The problem that we're now solving is to construct an implementation of a
function, byte4_sum, that takes two 4-bit bytes and returns a 4-bit byte
representing the sum while simply discarding any high-order overflow bit.

With the addition of natural numbers and the concept of recursive functions
to our toolkit (through the nat module), We're now in a position to take on
this problem.

Our overall strategy for constructing a satisfactory implementation will be
top-down functional decomposition, realized by systematically introducing,
and then constructing code to fill, holes in Idris code.

We already have our implementation of the top-level byte4_plus function.
We're done at that level. Here's the function implementation.

========

||| addition
export
byte4_plus': Byte4 -> Byte4 -> Byte4
byte4_plus' b0 b1 =
  byte4_new
    (sum_sub nat_three b1 b0)
    (sum_sub nat_two   b1 b0)
    (sum_sub nat_one   b1 b0)
    (sum_sub nat_zero  b1 b0)

========

This function implementation uses a lower-level function called sum_sub.
The sum_sub function takes an index (a natural number) and two 4-bit bytes
and that returns the indexed bits in the two given bytes. If the index is
too large for the number of bits in the bytes, the function will return B0.
That's it!

We make the code compile by declaring the type of sum_sub and by binding
it to a hole that we will then have to refine into working code. The key
when we introduce the hole is that we understand precisely what that code
will eventually have to do. In the case of sum_sub, for example, it must
take an index and two bytes and return the index-designated bit in the sum
of the two bytes.

Now we just recurse! That is, we apply the same strategy at 'the next level
down." To be clear, we need an implementation of sum_sub, and we can use the
same tricks in constructing it. It's jobs is pretty simple if you look at the
diagram of byte addition: the job of sum_sub is to add the three bits in one
column of a byte addition problem: the carry value from the previous column
and the two bits in the present column. That's it.

So now we write the code; and once again we write it to clearly express the
essence of the problem we're solving, introducing yet lower-level functions
as might be required to achieve our aim of clarity, precision, elegance and
of course logical and mathematical correctness.

Following next is the code, including the use of two functions that we have
yet to implement. The first is carry_sub. The second is byte4_sub.

The carry_sub function takes an index n and two bytes and returns the carry
bit in the indexed column. The byte4_sub function takes an index and a bytes
and returns the indexed bit of the given byte. If indices are too big, these
functions return the zero bit (B0).

========

-- compute the indexed bit of the sum of the given bytes
sum_sub: Nat -> Byte4 -> Byte4 -> Bit
sum_sub n b1 b0 =
  bit_plus3
    (carry_sub n b1 b0)
    (byte4_sub n b1)
    (byte4_sub n b0)

========

It's important to grasp that when applying the method of top-down functional
decomposition, can simply assume that we have the lower-level functions that
we need ("wish we had") to make our code easy to write and understand. We go
back and fill in the hole later. In this way, we maintain clarity and control
at each level of decomposition. Here's the stub code for our present problem.

========

||| Return the indexed bit of the given byte or B0 if the index is out of range
export
byte4_sub: Nat -> Byte4 -> Bit
byte4_sub n b4 = ?byte4_sub_hole
-- this function is stubbed out; the hole must be filled!


||| Return the carry bit in the indexed column when adding the two bytes
||| or the zero bit (B0) if the index is out of range
carry_sub: Nat -> Byte4 -> Byte4 -> Bit
carry_sub n b1 b0 = ?carry_sub_hole
-- this function is stubbed out; the hole must be filled!

========

Now all we have to do is resolve the remaining holes. You can find working code
as described here in my github repo, under tag v4.1
